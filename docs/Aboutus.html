              <p>
                Pastor Tiffany Phipps-Jones is a devoted mother, minister, and
                gifted singer who has been using her voice to glorify God since
                the age of five. Blessed with a powerful gift of song, she has
                shared her talents on numerous platforms, inspiring and
                uplifting many through music and ministry. Her journey of faith
                took a defining turn at the age of 16 when she gave her life to
                Christ. In 2014, she deepened her commitment to the call of God
                by attending Ministry School at Sons of Thunder and was ordained
                as a minister that same year. After years of dedicated service,
                she was ordained as a pastor in 2023, marking the next chapter
                of her spiritual leadership. In 2024, Pastor Tiffany
                Phipps-Jones was appointed as the Pastor of Assembly of the
                Saints of God, where she officially began leading services in
                2025. Her passion for ministry is fueled by her love for God and
                a desire to see lives transformed. She continues to serve
                faithfully, sharing the gospel, encouraging believers, and using
                her voice—both in song and in word—to bring glory to the Kingdom
                of God.
