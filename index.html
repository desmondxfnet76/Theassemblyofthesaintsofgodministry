                    <p>Pastor Tiffany Phipps-Jones is a devoted mother, minister, and gifted singer who has been using her voice to glorify God since the age of five.

In 2014, she deepened her commitment to the call of God by attending Ministry School at Sons of Thunder and was ordained as a minister that same year. After years of dedicated service, she was ordained as a pastor in 2023, marking the next chapter of her spiritual leadership.
                        
                        In 2024, Pastor Tiffany Phipps-Jones was appointed as the Pastor of Assembly of the Saints of God, where she officially began leading services in 2025. Her passion for ministry is fueled by her love for God and a desire to see lives transformed. She continues to serve faithfully, sharing the gospel, encouraging believers, and using her voice—both in song and in word—to bring glory to the Kingdom of God.</p>
